**Effective Date:** August 10, 2025

Cloudy Calculator is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension operates entirely offline and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

## Information Collection

## How the Extension Works
- All calculations and unit conversions are performed **locally in your browser**.
- User preferences (such as default units or options set in the Options page) are stored locally using Chrome’s `storage` API and **never leave your device**.

## Third-Party Services
- The extension **does not** communicate with or send data to any third-party services.
